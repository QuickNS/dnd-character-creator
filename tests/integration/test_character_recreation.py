"""
Integration tests for character recreation from choices_made.

These tests verify that characters can be fully rebuilt from a choices_made dictionary
and that all species, class, and subclass effects are correctly applied.

Test Coverage:
- Level 3 Dwarf Cleric (Light Domain) - Verifies:
  * Dwarf species traits (Dwarven Resilience, Toughness, Poison Resistance)
  * Cleric spellcasting and Divine Order
  * Light Domain spell effects (Burning Hands, Faerie Fire, etc.)
  * Speed, darkvision, and other physical traits

- Level 3 Wood Elf Fighter (Champion) - Verifies:
  * Wood Elf lineage traits (Druidcraft cantrip, increased speed)
  * Elf base traits (darkvision, weapon proficiencies)
  * Fighter class features (Fighting Style selection)
  * Champion archetype features (Improved Critical)

- Level 3 Infernal Tiefling Warlock (Fiend) - Verifies:
    * Tiefling species traits (Darkvision, Otherworldly Presence)
    * Infernal Tiefling lineage traits (Fire resistance, Infernal Legacy spells)
    * Warlock class features and Fiend patron features

These tests serve as comprehensive integration tests that exercise:
1. Character building pipeline from choices_made
2. Species/lineage effect application
3. Class feature implementation
4. Subclass feature implementation
5. Effect system functionality
6. JSON export completeness

The tests are designed to be realistic - they create characters that would
actually be built through the web interface and verify the core mechanics
are working correctly.
