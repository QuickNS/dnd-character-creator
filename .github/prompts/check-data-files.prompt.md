Check all files under data/ folder against their corresponding data models in the models/ folder:

Please provide:

* A brief summary of compliance
* If issues can be easily fixed (e.g., wrong property names, missing required fields), provide corrected versions of the files
* If issues are complex (e.g., incorrect data structures), describe what needs to be changed
* After fixing, confirm all files now comply with their schemas
* Generate a data-file-report.md file with all the issues found and the fixes applied
