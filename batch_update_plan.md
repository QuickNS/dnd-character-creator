## Recommended Approach

Since this is a large task (approximately 4-8 hours of work for complete accuracy), consider:

1. **Incremental Updates**: Update 2-3 classes per session
2. **Test As You Go**: Create test characters after each class update
3. **Focus on What You Need**: Update classes your players are using first
4. **Use the Pattern**: The druid subclasses show the correct JSON structure

## Update Template
Each update needs:
- Proper D&D 2024 descriptions
- Correct feature progression by level
- Accurate spell slots (for casters)
- Subclass features at correct levels (usually 3, 6, 10, 14)
