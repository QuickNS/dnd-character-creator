  "traits": {
    "Chromatic Ancestry": "You trace your ancestry to a chromatic dragon, granting you a special magical affinity.",
    "Chromatic Breath Weapon": "When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. Choose acid (black), cold (white), fire (red), lightning (blue), or poison (green). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the chosen type. On a successful save, it takes half damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",
    "Damage Resistance": "You have resistance to the damage type of your draconic ancestry.",
    "Chromatic Warding": "Starting at 5th level, as an action, you can channel your draconic energy to protect yourself. For 1 minute, you become immune to the damage type associated with your Chromatic Ancestry. Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest."
