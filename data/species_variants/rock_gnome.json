When you create the device, you determine its function by choosing one effect from Prestidigitation; the device produces that effect whenever you or another creature takes a Bonus Action to activate it with a touch. You can have three such devices in existence at a time, and each falls apart 8 hours after its creation or when you dismantle it as a Utilize action.",
