    "Metallic Breath Weapon": "When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with an exhalation in a 15-foot cone. Choose acid (copper), cold (silver), fire (gold), lightning (bronze), or poison (brass). Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC = 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed save, the creature takes 1d10 damage of the chosen type. On a successful save, it takes half damage. This damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10). You can use your Breath Weapon a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.",

The save DC for this breath weapon is 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. Whenever you use this trait, choose one: Enervating Breath (Force each creature in the area to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 1d8 force damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and its speed isn't reduced), or Repulsion Breath (Force each creature in the area to make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 15 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature is not pushed). Once you use this trait, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest."
