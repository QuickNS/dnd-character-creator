Starting at 5th level, you can also cast the Flame Blade spell with it. Once you cast Burning Hands or Flame Blade with this trait, you can't cast that spell with it again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells."
