      "Divination Savant": "The gold and time you must spend to copy Divination spells into your spellbook is halved.",
      "Portent": "You can glimpse the future and use it to aid your allies or hinder your enemies. When you finish a long rest, roll two d20s and record the numbers rolled. You can replace any attack roll, saving throw, or ability check made by you or a creature you can see with one of these foretelling rolls."

      "Expert Divination": "Casting divination spells comes so easily to you that it expends only a fraction of your spellcasting efforts. When you cast a divination spell of 2nd level or higher using a spell slot, you regain one expended spell slot. The slot you regain must be of a level lower than the spell you cast and can't be higher than 5th level."

    "10": {
      "The Third Eye": "You can use your action to increase your powers of perception. When you do so, choose one of the following benefits, which lasts until you are incapacitated or you take a short or long rest: Darkvision (60 feet), Ethereal Sight, Greater Comprehension, or See Invisibility."

    "14": {
      "Greater Portent": "The visions in your dreams intensify and paint a more accurate picture of what is to come. You roll three d20s for your Portent feature, rather than two."
