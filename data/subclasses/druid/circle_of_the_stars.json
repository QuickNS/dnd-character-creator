      "Star Map": "You've created a star chart as part of your heavenly studies. It is a Tiny object, and you can use it as a Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells. While holding the map, you have the Guidance and Guiding Bolt spells prepared, and you can cast Guiding Bolt without expending a spell slot. You can cast it in that way a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. If you lose the map, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to magically create a replacement.",
      "Starry Form": {
        "description": "As a Bonus Action, you can expend a use of your Wild Shape feature to take on a starry form rather than shape-shifting. While in your starry form, you retain your game statistics, but your body becomes luminous. This form sheds Bright Light in a 10-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 10 feet. The form lasts for 10 minutes. Whenever you assume your starry form, choose which constellation glimmers on your body.",
        "constellations": {
          "Archer": "When you activate this form and as a Bonus Action on your subsequent turns while it lasts, you can make a ranged spell attack, hurling a luminous arrow that targets one creature within 60 feet of yourself. On a hit, the attack deals Radiant damage equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.",
          "Chalice": "Whenever you cast a spell using a spell slot that restores Hit Points to a creature, you or another creature within 30 feet of you can regain Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom modifier.",
          "Dragon": "When you make an Intelligence or a Wisdom check or a Constitution saving throw to maintain Concentration, you can treat a roll of 9 or lower on the d20 as a 10."

      "Cosmic Omen": "Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can consult your Star Map for omens and roll a die. Until you finish your next Long Rest, you gain access to a special Reaction based on whether you rolled an even or an odd number: Weal (Even) - roll 1d6 and add to a D20 Test within 30 feet; Woe (Odd) - roll 1d6 and subtract from a D20 Test within 30 feet. You can use this Reaction a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest."

      "Twinkling Constellations": "The constellations of your Starry Form improve. The 1d8 of the Archer and the Chalice becomes 2d8, and while the Dragon is active, you have a Fly Speed of 20 feet and can hover. Moreover, at the start of each of your turns while in your Starry Form, you can change which constellation glimmers on your body."
