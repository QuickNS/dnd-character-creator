  "name": "The Great Old One",
  "description": "Your patron is a mysterious entity whose nature is utterly foreign to the fabric of reality. It might come from the Far Realm, the space beyond reality, or it could be one of the elder gods known only in legends. Its motives are incomprehensible to mortals, and its knowledge so immense and ancient that even the greatest libraries pale in comparison to the vast secrets it holds.",

      "Telepathic Communication": "Your patron bestows upon you the ability to communicate telepathically. You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you.

      "Entropic Ward": "You learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest."

You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence."
