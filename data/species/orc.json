  "description": "Orcs trace their creation to Gruumsh, a powerful god who roamed the wide open spaces of the Material Plane. Even when they turn their devotion to other gods, orcs retain Gruumsh's gifts: endurance, determination, and the ability to see in darkness. Orcs are, on average, tall and broad with gray skin, sharply pointed ears, and prominent lower canines that resemble small tusks.",
