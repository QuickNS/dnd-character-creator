  "description": "Cherished and guided by gods who value life, home, and hearth, halflings gravitate toward bucolic havens where family and community help shape their lives. Their size - similar to that of a human child - helps them pass through crowds unnoticed and slip through tight spaces. They live for about 150 years and possess the storied luck of the halflings.",
